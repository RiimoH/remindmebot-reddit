What is the point of SolvedBot?

Many redditors are searching for specific things on reddit. Many requests are unanswerd or take time to be answerd. Instead of requesting a RemindMe-message which has a preset timer, this bot will notify everyone when a solution is found. If you want to help with the search there is also the option to get notifications for partial solutions. 

This Bot is entirely based on the original RemindMeBot which you can find here: http://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/24duzp/remindmebot_info/
